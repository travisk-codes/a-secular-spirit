Reason
Purpose of reason section is to build up justification for spirit section (mainly that spirit corresponds to other interconnections at lower scales
The patterns become more complicated (from simple symmetries to spacial (3d eg electron orbits) symmetries to further complex structures and further and further until you reach humans and then you add one more level which is interpersonal relationships
inevitability of global unification
“Our goal” is to create heaven on earth for all who are born, ideally all who are conceived, world peace
What is our current status on the path to our goal? Arguing over what constitutes a better basis for cooperation (capitalism, communism), bringing the entire world up to a tolerable base level basic level (eratication of disease, poverty, famine), and getting global organs to fully cooperate (globalization, war, developing countries)
^ our current status from the perspective of a single entity, humanity/universe

oxygen molecule, two blobs of quarks with a certain number of electrons around each to allow them to stick to one another, build up new def for quarks earlier in book, exits julius cesear lungs and enters yours, find that, find better idea. talk about how an artery or vein is within x mm (find length of bateria or something) of tissue or whatever factoid. x number of cells! feeds each cell, each cell morphed from a single kind of cell, the instantiation of a human being, see certain section with regard to abortion, was going somewhere else as well... i forget. oh, we are fully replaced every 7 year, that factoid, see if exceptions like teeth or whatnot. just continuous waves of patterns, the faster and wavier the smaller you look. dancing tangles of energy building ever more complex braids. this will go after building up from cosmic egg, particles breaking apart, glow transition, use a bright light, farther away the less bright, then with fog at night or a heavy snowstorm with sun (sol, soul) overhead use Our Body once for earth then just use 'our body' our world is the planet, and the planet's world is the entire universe, or 'the world', so earth is 'our world', universe 'the world'

if you were a [species] frog, you would be able to see or detect individual photons. a source of light from far away may dim to nothing for us, but the [species] frog would see a source of light flickering off and on very very quickly, mostly on, eventually just flashing a few seconds in-between
those few photons probably won't cause the frog to do much anything different, but it might
it may spot a cascading sensation of light from a coming fire-bearer, and jump away to safety
the same can be said for humans, but the light will simply be faint and grow brighter
that briefest of sensation could have wildly changed how you behaved
that light could be people coming to your rescue, or dreaded enemies on the prowl
this goes for the light from mars as well
if you have ever gazed up at that tiny red dot, it has had an effect on you
for most it may cause you to look up and nothing more
for some they gazed up right before kissing their partner for the first time
perhaps she got a tattoo of mars along with her partner, and it played as a beautiful motif for the rest of their lives
these small influences growing to huge changes are coming from everywhere, even as far away as mars
but mars is 100 million thousand meters away, 300,000,000 meters/s -> nearly an hour ago
even the sun is a few minutes in the past, were it to disappear we wouldn't immediately know
what we are, if we were to section off our body all we would be is a surface absorbing light and repelling electrons
our experience would simply be the fluctuations of energy or signals over this 2d boundary
instead, who and what we are extends out from your head, absorbing the past as it was 10 ms ago, then 1 second ago, then an hour ago, all the way out to the entire cosmos, as best as we can see it
we now know that who we are extends out until gravity was created because we experience the ripples of spacetime from objects like black holes from very far away, beyond where the light goes out
particles, little 0d points in space, are better described as one giant wave, spreading out as we move forward in time
we are learning that we are connected all together as one planet, one system, one galaxy, one universe
right now our capabilities are just barely reaching out beyond our planet
humans right now are committing perhaps the first global sin
we are not empowering those who understand the gravity of the situation
scores of beautiful species, expressions of god, will go extinct, and will only exist in recordings or fading memories
mass migration from places less habitable will grow in numbers
millions will be casualties
humanity will survive, we are a proud, hardy ape, but it will be shrouded in sadness

this is what we are, as best as we are able to tell
before the gravity of dust pulled itself together to form the earth, those specks of matter traveled from the inside of a star
maybe our dust ball comes from many different stars
before there were stars, there was a lot of hydrogen, which again pooled together into globs of matter, perpetually exploding from its immense energy
the hydrogen (and the rest of the gas atoms) was more energetic the farther you look back
eventually they are heated to the point where they fly apart, electrons bouncing against nucleons and light bouncing around both
suddenly there is bright orange light coming from every direction in space, as photons scatter about traveling millions of miles before entering your eye
you can see your hand, your body, and anything else around you, but distant objects fade into the blinding orange fog
as everything gets more crowded, bouncing against one another with ever-greater speed, the nucleons fly apart, releasing quarks and gluons to ricochet off electrons and photons
soon the light surrounding you grows dim, as all the photons grow to ever higher frequency
the world grows blue and then black as the light receeds from our color spectrum
forces begin merging together, combining particles together into things we have never witnessed
eventually you are left with simply one force, a smooth energy spread throughout an increasingly shrinking space
at some point time stops, and we are left with a single thing
moving forward in time tells about the same story
a simple pervasive energy split apart, into things that could then be put back together in interesting patterns
quarks begin sticking together, forming charges which interact with electrons
light appears, creeping from dark blue to white, which then fades to orange
as the quarks and electrons lost their energy, stable nucleon-electron waves began to form, spreading out into an expanding space
as locations became vacant of charge, being constrained to stable neutral regions separated by small distances of space, photons were able to travel among the atoms unimpeded, traveling billions of years until hitting your eye or another atom.
this moment of time, when light became unimpeded can be seen when plotting the cosmic microwave background
a photon was allowed to travel in a straight line, losing energy as it is stretched through space, then hit the lens of a satellite
the atoms formed stars, and those stars formed bigger atoms, and those bigger atoms form you
first they group into simple patterns, different configurations of atoms stuck together from their electrons
these tiny groups grow into more complex patterns, large spacial configurations of dozens of different atoms
the bigger pieces begin to clump together
those bigger pieces grow into a living organism, with a variety of complex systems maintaining a process inside a tiny bag of water
those tiny bags clump together, creating more clumps similar to it, and given enough time these clumps will turn into a human

just look at the other, what you want, and aim towards that, perf and all

- Stars are not how far away but rather how long ago
- The longer I go the less it affects you or rather a sphere around you a star it's light it's gravity it's affect on me could be described not could can be described with very little information very little very high entropy
- The information the entry crosses the spherical boundary this circle boundary the entropy crosses
- connect back to Mars and the proposal
- consider Vega for most people they will never know what Vega is and that's okay most people will gaze up not knowing what they're looking at but noticing the brightness of one particular one particular star this will affect some subset of the human population or rather all living things like the Earth itself the Earth is one living thing the moon the moon has tons of entropy it affects everyone vega may not affect someone who doesn't know what they're looking at but it plays a small small part in their lives an astronomer dedicates their life to stars like viga and this greatly influences their life The information stored in the brain encoded in the electrochemical loops Is highly entangled with all of us but more so with the astronomer because there is more information being held inside your sphere The information crossing your sphere The Earth is one living thing and that is what makes it so precious that is the blue marble
- the moon influences as greatly but it is not a living thing The sun gives us life but it is not life itself itself is not living it itself is not living
- that is what makes us special that is what makes us one thing
- The center of the Earth is not living we are simply a moss grown around a massive clump of dirt but the dirt also gives us energy the dirt and the sun are stores of energy that give birth the father is the son the Earth is the mother and we are the moss that has grown around it
- we are highly intangled with the other side of the Earth both with scar with regards to space time as well as the information as it travels from one sphere when subset of the big sphere this big information sphere that is the Earth what the crosses from one subset of the Earth IE a liter of a deleter Japan the liter of Japan deleter of Japan wow extra information such as what new policy is inacted and how it affects your site of the Earth that is extra information on top of the physical information which makes up the physical emperor there's information and tangled in his brain most of it unless he dies or something else happens to his whole body mind is subset of body or maybe solid subset of mind because that is the glue it's social like a pack of dogs um yes so the necessary ingredient for the connection between humans it a substance of the mind or maybe more fundamental of and the mind is a subset of the body so maybe the mind is more fundamental than the body that does make sense oh no um mine does built up from the body The body has built up from the earth the soul is built up from the mind it is a pinnacle it is perhaps more beautiful
- what we are like is a video game we have a state a position on the map a certain number of health points and so on we also have rules by which the state changes in time for an AI enemy there are rules steps discreet steps by which it changes with time such as approaching or firing at you there are exact rules Andy you follow these rules yourself but that let's not think about that right now likewise we have a state a position for instance where you are or where every particle in your body is the fuzzing the fuzzing between the particles as information travels from point to point there's a constant jiggling because things are constantly moving because they don't have an entirely definite position look into that this fuzzing is what allows you to travel through the world's or navigate your branch in your brain your space time braid
- elaborate on this braid it is a braid because unlike the game which ticks in very tiny discreet steps our time is continuous space time is continuous and because we are fortunational beans not three dimensional plus time we are four dimensional what seems like a point is actually traced a line of energy through a braid these different braids as they constantly split apart Is that entropy when there's more splitting apart the more you have to know how things change as they ever they branch out they they constantly bloom out a perpetually blooming flower with ever more petals behind the last the next
- this braid the more complex the braid the more entropy the more information it requires and that is why a random star in the sky does not add as much information because it's only sending a fuzzy wave of electrons
- and then go into how we discovered that the rule the rules by which our game state changes describes a wave a particle is a ripple we are just one point along this ripple but like a drop of water like a drop of water hitting a pond spreads out in all directions this spreading is the infinite regress of petals

like any model every word in this text is false, but it might be useful

when time first began there was only energy. no particular time pure in its form. there was also bass space, rapidly inflating outwards due to this presence of energy. it all pushed away from itself

at some point, the singular energy split apart into two different kinds, one which pushes and pulls, and one that only pulls[1.1

knowing a position between the moon and the earth to within the breadth of a human hair (12 decimal points)

a particle is the cross-section of a braid an energy braid a braid of energy

field sits at zero, but if you look, its fluctuating around zero. look closer, bigger flucs, more energetic particles? 
knot is quarks, gluons jump gap

it is only on rare occasions that you do not feel the ground beneath your feet it is not that we are simply tethered to the Earth we are extensions of it

The branching that Sean Carroll talks about the gradually getting thinner of a particular world can be thought of as a hardening. when we think of ourselves as spreading out Is not just us that spreads out it is the whole earth it is every object in the universe every interaction the reason that solid objects do not behave quantum mechanically Is this hardening this crystallization of interactions a single particle two single particles pretty out somewhere in the wave function of the universe this spherical body of water with different kinds of waves overlapping one another locations particular spots where two waves meet have a tendency or can stick together like protons and neutrons nucleons and electrons a nucleon is not little ball stuck together it is one big sphere that spreads out that has an extent in space due to the uncertainty principle the same reason that degenerate matter is I guess so hot um so I am branching out I'm spreading out I'm walking around in different patterns in different worlds oh but as the special extensives begin gluing together over larger distances it's not able to spread out as much because information has to travel between those distances this is also where MC squared comes into play the c squared it is I guess how much to say photos able to spread out over a period of time which is some sort of area some sort of velocity squared area

film soundtrack that is composed only of heartbeat rhythms where the number of rhythms allowed is equal to the number of characters being portrayed on screen


picture 2 points on our circle pond spherical hollow shell pond with different kinds of waves Ripley together and two particles of two different fields meet this moment of the two particles meeting two dots being carried out from two spherical wave fronts they meet and that meeting point itself begins to spread out and say a spherical wavefront or perhaps directed but because these two particles might stick together and because momentum must be conserved these two faster particles maze slow down and therefore not able to spread out as much spread out at the circular cross sections of the light cone I guess so maybe the stitching together of space time are these little areas spreading out spreading out of possibility proportional to the area of c squared

picture yourself driving in your car with a falcon with a bird watching over head or better yet a time lapse from a spy satellite you will appear to circle around or hover around particular spots maybe there are different spots within a larger spot with sudden jumps to another spot corresponding to wind you were driving your car from spot-to-spot these themselves will form loops larger connections most people make the same commute every day following the same loop but they also go other places perhaps less frequently and perhaps they travel far very rarely looked at fast enough you will look like a particle moving around in a larger emergent pattern these patterns spread out along with the entire Earth and every particle in the universe the observable universe but much more slowly than a particle or an atom or a molecule

all structures spread out as waves, but when we go to look, we see where we are in the wave represented by some structure : at the bottom, just particles, points of energy . particles combine, creating combinations of two or three or four . some of these combinations last longer than others . but these new structures, multi-particle blobs spreading out in The Wave, now have relations to one another, are influenced by one another, and occupy positions not just within The Wave, but among themselves . this pattern repeats . particles or instances in the wave or locations in the wave, combine into larger structures, occupying a greater amount of space in which to place these bag of point energies . when two or more point energies combine (locations in space combine) and become a single structure, they must remain in the same proximity of one another . they may jiggle and vibrate, but to unfasten from one another takes more effort than to simply stay connected . the greater the distance in space, the farther light/info has to travel, and the longer it takes for the continual update of eachothers location, this constricting prevents one from wandering off too far from the other, whereas single particles can travel as fast as they want, having no baggage this constricts not just their motion, but also the amount that they can spread in the wave . a molecule can still spread out far, but we are less likely to observe it from where we are in the wave . point energies to 1-structs to 2-structs (atoms) to 3-structs (molecules) as we go further up levels, relationships between particles become less abstract, and more similar to our everyday experiences. the stability of 1-structs relies on triplet relationships and strangely behaving waveforms (kinds of energies which split apart (energyforms?), 2-structs show spherical patterns of energy and a basic spacial structure (center point + cloud), 3-structs begin to enter the realm where more sense can be made. 2nd structs combine together with much more definite spacial locations relative to one another. how they fit together relies on the more-abstract spherical shapes of 2nd structs, but how 3rd structs fit together depends just on where everyone is relative to one another . you can't take up someone else's space, and you stick to your position relative to your neighbors (thinking of an organic molecule or something) 3rd structs then begin able to interact with other 3rd structs, bags of blobs of points, to create larger bags of blobs of points of waveforms, but at larger and larger sizes of bags, the push-pull of em becomes less important, and the spacial location or extent or structure or shape that the 3struc has. more and more like blobby building blocks, gooey shapes which combine together into ever larger blobs, forming new relationships between the larger structs, as well as the smaller structs holding up those relationships. a blob learns to move a smaller blob to a much bigger blob to keep it making a different kind of blob. this relationship could directly involve 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or maybe 5th structs? 3rd -> molecules -> 4th compounds -> 5th going into in/org stuff this can lead to rocks, where 2nd and 3rd level structures dominate on a large scale (large being, a whole rock!) to humans, where 4th compounds/amino-acids -> 5th proteins -> 6th complexes -> 7th organelles -> 8th cells -> 9th organs -> 10th consciousness? -> 11th terra -> 12th god ? this is where we need to fit in replicators and re-read selfish gene

'recombination epoch' are the assigned symbols to refer to this moment when the 1strucA[1:electrons] and 2strucA[2:protons] grew cold enough to stick together, separated by space between, much larger than the space between 1strucBs[3:quarks] inside the 2strucAs . with more noticable patterns created by the spread of those distances (the spherical harmonic orbitals) . the wild mess of positive and negative point charges evenly mixed throughout space, which had caused the foggy diffuse light, photons jostled every which direction . now positive and negative points are constrained to vibrate near one another in specific locations. the overlap causes charge outside their spacial extent to quickly approach zero, allowing photons to travel more or less straight through, be that between two atoms, or one atom itself . when we look out at the sky at night, there is a photon travelling from one particular spot, or rather many from a spot, but make that spot smaller and smaller, you will get to the point where that circle area contains only one photon (make it smaller and there's likely to be none?) that single photon was released from the fog when a 2 and 1 struct combine, and has been travelling straight from that instant to now, hitting your eye (or super frog eye so we can see it)
or hitting your spherical shell, perhaps constructing you from every other particle in the universe from the information sitting on the surface of the shell . 

1d wave to 2d speckle pattern to 3d particle pattern

a solar sail works by absorbing the momentum of photons hitting the mirror-like foil wings . but photons don't have a mass, so how can they transfer momentum ? what they don't have is rest mass . in the frame of reference of an electron, zipping around with it, the electron has some mass . in the frame of reference of a photon, length contraction and time dilation has squashed the entire universe, or all space around it, into a flat disk, perpendicular to the direction of travel . likewise, time has completely stopped . a photon seen from our perspective ('seen') moves location with time, but it sees us down somewhere on a flat disk . does this 2d and 1t compactification translate to a part of the braid, not the braid, the string, moving into a third dimension we cannot see? or its universe changing with time? or maybe this flat universe with a photon in its center is just some spread out location in the wave ? when the solar sail speeds up, the light in front of it will be blueshifted slightly, hitting the front with greater energy (smaller wavelength), and at some point would require more and more energy to push against this greater pressure of energy . picture the rest of the em spectrum as just more colors maybe the eye the size of a world could see the color of radio waves . we already look at color corrected ones 

find object with most pictures in different wavelengths, or picture taken with widest wavelength diff, color correct all to the same color, sin fade between lowest and highest wavelength, see how it changes ? 

if you were a massive particle, perhaps one that can see all the colors of the spectrum, and you continued to accelerate, your universe would become more squat in the direction of travel . and everything happening in your universe would slow down . keep going, and your perspective approaches that of a photon, pushing up against this universe-wide boundary, everything inside slowing to a snail's pace . is it a position in the wave ?

The soul is what appears when a one-person universe is turned into a two-person universe The change is not just the addition of one person it is the connection between the two that would be different if they were a different person and would not be there at all in a one person universe

there's something that appears in groups that is not there before this is usually where liberals and conservatives talk past one another because one is talking about the individual and the other is talking about the group

for instance right now the police The police force is a hole is a somewhat contentious issue one side Is talking about the group and the issues at a system level a social structure The other is talking about the individual and the risks and dangers and of the job and the honor in that

this can be scaled up from one to two to ten to a hundred to the Earth as an argument for their being a global soul one giant spherical shell of carbon arranged in complex intricate patterns arising from the individual knowing themselves knowing themself to the earth knowing herself and just like how the soul between three people is different than two people because there are more connections more more interaction between person a and b and person a and c and person b and c and how they see themselves such as c to c that isn't there that change requires other people so even well that makes sense your self is not some immutable thing it is is a perception a self-perception that can change over time and if you are around people that look you up you will have a self that you like and if you have people that bring you down you'll have someone you may not like as much
so is more and more people are added you get diminishing returns because there's only so much time to socialize which is to spread out your soul and as you get from person to person a person to person your soul is less and less there soon it becomes only knowledge of your existence of your name to maybe a name that has been forgotten but can still be found in one's head if reminded for example so but still the dynamic changes because you're interacting with someone who is also spread out as much as you are or hopefully as much as they prefer and that changes the connection between that you and that other person but once the connection has reached the scale of the entire Earth as well as the humans orbiting around her your soul your connection to everyone as well as your notion of self are different than if it were say such as we are now where nations have sold have strong self-souls but their connection to other massive reservoirs of souls IE other nations are less strong Americans care more about Americans than are minions are minions Armenian there we go Americans care more about Americans than Armenians when it's global the the strongest connection possible each individual knowing that they are that they are of the earth below them as well as every living thing on earth that is when be our highest form of life and our greatest potential as a living thing

go after the argument that if the soul wasn't there then it would be two individuals both acting as if they are alone both thinking that they are alone even though they see another person that is the absence of soul

I share a soul with Donald Trump and it is not a good one oh heaven is good soul and hell is bad soul so hell like you know being a parent of an adolescent in modern day Syria say when bombs are raining down

if we are simply some order arising from a larger resevoir of disorder, just by chance and the nature of energy at a location wanting to change (the wave has to keep rippling!) then the most common blips of "simpleness", closer to unity, closer to God, reaching closer, then we would probably be in those less ambitious, easier to make universes . all you need is one galaxy, right? or just one star? that's a lot easier to make than what we see . what we are . "observer selection bias" . if entropy must always increase, if things get less simple . again visit the videogame analogy . there is a world, and it changes in time . a goomba does not stay still . a goomba has places to go, and has to know what happens when they hit a wall . yadda yadda yadda so your game state is a chair in a room . it does nothing, so you just put one thing in one position . but the way the game changes, is after some amount of time the chair will break into two . every time that happens you double the number of things and locations of those things . a chair breaks in two, you have part 1 here and part 2 there . those break, four parts, 16, 32 and each time, the amount of information you have to keep track of keeps taking up more and more space . you have to keep track of more, and it never becomes less . that is a hard-coded rule of our universe. our start kept track of maybe a few hundred things (look into this . planck volumes after planck time) and will eventually have to keep track of over 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 things (10^88 particles ? when everything ultimately dissolves?) capernican : this is probably typical by definition
anthropic : we must find ourselves somewhere capable of creating ourselves
caperopic or anthrnican : find ourselves in the most typical of places that can create observers, even if those places are rare among all the places possible . this says something interesting about alien life . in most observer friendly locations, we will find aliens that are more or less like us . maybe looking different, but probably mammalian ? twist those knobs a bit and you may find rarer forms of life , forms that may achieve high speed space travel, live forever, and are very patient . maybe they experience time much quicker than we do . or more slowly . but in most regions of God, we will find creatures that more or less operate the same way we do . 
but because we find ourselves in such a large universe, and not one with just one galaxy or one star, we are probably not a random fluctuation . lol we are therefore probably close to the end of the universe . we are much more likely to be in a region that is about to end than one that just began, i guess ? 
no physics equation is exact, no model describes a system perfectly . but sometimes a simple model can approach the system, or reality, so closely that there appears to be something special about that model, those equations, that math, those symbols on the page. The World, Our World, is a sphere, which, when described with symbols, is very simple , which some would say makes it ' beautiful ' . even more so, the planets move in circles around the sun . a sphere is a three-dimensional circle, and a circle is a two-dimensional sphere . they are written as x^2+y^2=c, having 9 symbols, or even more simply: ce^ix, having bleh symbols. except The Earth is not a sphere, and the planets do not circle around the sun . because the earth rotates , it tends to bulge around the middle . this is closer to the shape called an ' oblate spheroid ' . and the planets travel in ellipses around the sun, not circles . but again these particular shapes, while not as simple as circles and spheres , can be described with relatively few symbols . and the model that we create, the model of math, the math model, is incredibly close to reality. so close that you wouldn't think you could get any closer . except again these are not an exact mapping of what happens . in reality , the planets throw each other slightly off course when near one another , and the earth is obviously not an oblate spheroid, because there are mountains and valleys . as it turns out, there are very short lists of symbols describing both of these so close to perfect , that you would be forgiven for thinking the equations describe reality perfectly . then go on to talk about qm

it may not feel like it, but at this moment you are spreading out like a wave . the spinning is the spreading . you are just at one spot in this wave . but if we were to look at all the spots at once, overlaying every copy of you into one of them, say the one you're in right now . actually first let's describe how a particle spreads out . if you were to take a particle, a dot of energy a point , a point energy , put it in a box all by itself, and then leave it be ,  the energy will spread out spherically in all three directions, becoming more diffuse as it does . one can roughly imagine taking a shower, afterwards taking all the water vapor particulates ( you can see them , but they're small ) and ball all them up into a small sphere in the center of the bathroom , and assuming none of the particles stick together , letting go and watching the sphere of water balls spread out , oh and quiet air . you can also think of smoke particulate , or anything small and or point like . we don't see that, because we are spreading out in all three directions as well, moving along with the diffusing of the point energy . whenever we looks, we only see a point energy and not something diffuse and spread out , but that is simply because we have no choice but to spread out with the particle , and so knowing our location means the point energy also has a location . imagine being a tiny water skater on a pond , you are unable to see far in front of yourself because you're so small, but it looks mostly flat . finish analogy later . so yeah, here, restricting yourself to a single particle spreads you , and everything, the universe as you experience it , does so as well . now reality as we experience it means that there is no wave inside the box, always a point , but if we were to stack the spread to a single point , we would see something spreading out like a wave . it doesn't lose density , but it is just something to picture . a trillion points spreading out in every direction from a single spot . you have many more particles in yourself, approximately 7,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 particles . so see yourself spreading out if we were to stack all the yous into one space . there is you, very clearly reading right now , but you become spread out and blurry . you start turning your head to look at something . you get up and get a drink . all these yous and all variations are continually spreading out everywhere . very dimmly you may see a ghostly image of yourself getting up and jumping as high as you can . it is incredibly unlikely to happen, but it is possible , and so it happens . something about how a better version of yourself is closer than you think , and that person will exist no matter what , so why not have it be you ? or rather that spread of many yous , be a part of that part of the wave

the electron cloud sitting around an atom, when not observed, is just sitting there . there is nothing whizzing around, there is not any noticeable change of any kind . when we look it is at a spot . or rather, when we measure between here and there, making here and there really close together, and then slicing the world away into what looks like a small dot . 1d left and right of the measured interval are sliced away, 2d forward and back, and 3d up and down . you will find a slice of "the electron" or the slice is what we call an electron, but it is sliced away, and the rest is still there, just somewhere else . 

the electron spin, isn't 50% likely to be here and 50% likely to be there : it is 100% likely to be here and there , but there happens to be somewhere else.

a spot in a wave bobbing

why not just have three rotating vectors at each point? for each complex number in 3d space?

the energy is how fast the wave is wiggling in time, and the momentum is how steep the slopes are in space . faster wiggles and steeper slopes mean more energy and momentum .

why momentum ? because the total momentum of the universe is zero . a car is flying down the highway, but that highway is on the earth, which is flying around the sun . but the sun is whipping around the center of our galaxy in one of it's tendril-like arms , and our galaxy is flying towards another galaxy . or is that galaxy flying towards us ? the point is the momentum depends on what you're looking at and from where you are asking "what's the momentum?"
why not velocity ? 

take an electron, place it in an empty universe, and observe which way it's spinning . if you observe it again, it will be the same . if you rotate the universe about that electron 180 degrees in any direction, you will observe the same direction of spin ( you can go into why 1 and -1 are useful, because if it's spinning in one direction represented by the unit vector, if you're upside down you'll measure the same spin direction, but that unit vector is just pointing the other way ) if you rotate just a slight amount, you will most likely measure the same spin direction
picture a little planet(s)/mass(es) orbit around a big/heavy planet/mass . measure an electron, and it will be spinning . spinning in a direction . if you measure it again, but completely flipped over, you'll measure the same spin . you know which way the electron is spinning along that direction . if you measure the electron along a different axis, there's a 50-50 chance it is spinning up or down . if you move an angle near the perspective of the electron we've measured from , it will most likely be the same direction of spin ( just with a slightly different angle from the previous measurement ) from every direction, that spot of energy is spinning outward, with the spin arrow either pointing directly at you or away from you . the amount you don't know, the probability of spinning direction ( cw or ccw ) when measuring from a right angle to the previous measurement ( in a sense ' looking ' at the electron a certain way ) that just means that it is spinning both directions simultaneously, but you don't know which way . that spot ( and by extension the universe contained in a spherical shell centered at the spot of measurement, radiating outward at the speed of causality ( light) causality change-rate . this sphere engulfs the earth in a millisecond ? the moon in 8 seconds ? and then the sun in 8 minutes . ( we see the moon as it was 8 seconds ago, and the sun as it was 8 minutes ago . if the sun were to explode, we wouldn't know for 8 minutes ) this is how fast the fast ripples travel on the 4-sphere . the slow ripples have mass, or rather are slowed down for a few reasons 1 the the simple points of energy simply have a mass . different kinds with different amounts . electrons have a little . 2 composite particles slow each other down . the three quarks in a proton have to stick together , like three people running, each holding  ( tied around foot?) short ropes between themselves . if you get three people good enough, they could probably run pretty fast, but not as fast as one person alone, because there is still some hinderence from the rope 3 the kind from simply containing thermal/kinetic energy ? like a wound spring . anyway, when you measure the electron field at a point, it is spinning outward in every direction, both ways, ... but it is more like an event than an object!
there is magic in (the written word) (words), it allows the same thing to be seen in different ways . axis and allied propaganda are discussing the same event, but make a very different case for it . some other example, and then get on to physics, or maybe something about beast machines as a way to describe animals . domestic machines . but physics concepts can be described in many different ways, and words can lend themselves to different perspectives or analogies, and perhaps there is a best way to describe what all of physics really is . or at least a better way than what we have right now . e.g. ' atom '
if a cat, when sitting still, is not thinking about something, or feeling something, then it is meditating, by definition . in any case, the inner life of a cat is either similar to ours, or how we should strive to live . living in the moment (in the moment) . think of a bird speaking to you, or a monkey signing to you . one may think this is simply an elaborate trick, so let's start with that assumption . there is probably a better monkey or bird out there somewhere, and those best animals could get better . maybe the species as a whole is getting better at communication ( evolutionary pressure is probably just making them better at being birds/monkeys, but maybe communication is beneficial regardless? ) at what point is it no longer a trick ? or is our consciousness, our sentience, not simply an elaborate trick ? thinking, feeling, communicating are not something an animal either does or doesn't do . it is a smooth gradient, a spectrum, a continuous change in and among species . a cat thinks, a cat feels, and a cat communicates . and if it is doing none of those things, it is simply experiencing the world, not shut off because they still react to sound, but if not reacting to stimuli, then they are very likely in a state of bliss .
