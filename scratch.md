i want my book to have a form, a narrative, a story to tell. i can do this by first describing what it is i want to write, and then filling that out to write it. then edit. so what is my goal. see beyond yourself. argue the case that there is only one thing and that thing is you and me and the animals and the earth and the sun and the moon and all the stars and indeed everything there is in the universe and we can call that one thing god. then, we can use this knowledge to figure out what to do. how to behave. what's the goal. one such goal is the possibility of forward time travel, and when we get our shit together then we'll join a larger timeline. causal timeline. but also if you and me and the trees and the ocean are expressions of god, then we will want to treat ourselves as well as we can. a myriad of reasons. so, three sections right? 1. what we are: start from the beginning and a single particle. grow from there. sprinkle in some space and time. end at self-aware complex life, still described only in the abstract, with perhaps a concrete example here or there. use this as a base for the argument made in 2. you and i are one in the same, then all of the earth, then the whole universe. name this thing god, and schrodiger said god ripples. back this up with science. 3. is implications. go read a book about hume. What does this say about religion? 

there is a long pattern in science, of finding out there is a lot more stuff than we thought. land then planets then stars, one galaxy, many galaxies. go into the cosmic landscape. now go meditate.

In the beginning there was energy. Before there were many things, there was just one thing. physicists call this one thing energy, and theologians call it god. this one thing became two, then many, then billions, then googols, then uncountably more, possibly even an infinite number. these different things, just about everything, form patterns, there are small patterns, big ones, beautiful patterns and terrible ones. but each is incredible in its own way. one of these patterns is particularly important to humans, and we call that pattern ‘love’. it’s a messy pattern, for sure. the pattern of love is an intricate dance between billions of objects taking place over millions of years. These objects, projecting and bouncing off of one another in a myriad of brief intricate interactions, are only present again in a short moment in time, emerging from nothing and eventually disappearing again, spreading out among the others until all these things scattering about all look like just one big messy ball of frothing matter moving through spacetime, each instance an intricate braid of that one energy, god rippling about, forming ever smaller dances among itself. We are the objects, the one mass is earth, and the brief interactions, fancy vibrations bouncing against one another, is love. One of the patterns seen among all of these sacks of dirty water is holding hands. It is an expression of love among one or more people, and everyone does it because it is (more or less) universally agreed upon that it “feels good”. There are a lot, not nearly as many, but a lot of people who do not think holding hands feels good, and indeed there are much more between the two, if you look close enough an entire spectrum of people who would say that they believe holding hands with someone you want to hold hands with, and who also wants to hold hands with you, feels good. Spanning from the first to the last person, the just born, who while are not yet able to articulate it, clearly show content being held in their mother’s arms, to the hundred or so people who are dying this very minute, either holding the hand of loved ones, or wishes they were doing so. Ultimately, if you look close enough, each of us, these messy blobs emerging from the earth, dancing among themselves then spreading again out among everything else, are location-specific waves “wavelets” following relatively simple patterns, simple enough to put into short-ish math equations. Ultimately, you me, us, the earth, is made out of the whole thing [insert talk about extending to the sun, moon, system, galaxy, and ultimately the whole universe, mostly the cosmic microwave background, but a little bit before that as well, back when perhaps there were only a trillion things, or a billion, maybe even just a few. That far distant galaxy is not a part of you, but the photons and gravity being emitted from them are hitting us this very moment. It is both far away and a long time ago, but it is fully a part of your experience, whether you are looking through a telescope or not. You personally may not be effected that very moment, the galaxy may not even be facing you, visible in the sky. Maybe at the other end of the earth, but it does hit the earth, and on a long enough timescale, you and me and we and the earth are all the same thing.

Spirit
* mind, body, soul
  The triad
  The mind is not one mind, thank god, because diversity of thought is our greatest strength. We are not one body, thank god, because redundancy greatly benefits our physical surivival, and we are not one soul, because I’m likely to not have any social interaction with someone on the other side of the planet. But we’re not exactly different souls, I don’t think. Because the tendrils of causality expanding out of me, or the atoms that represent me at this event, may very well effect someone on the other side of the planet. I could join a growing company that eventually impoverishes a village. Compounding social interaction, even miniscule or minor, can ripple through the connections we all have to one another.
  Maybe thinking of one mind is just as extreme as thinking of many individual minds, because we are not individual minds, we become entangled as we braid ourselves through the universe together. It just looks very individualistic from our vantage points, and such is our soul, through those tiny tendrils we each thrust into the future.
  The atoms of our collective Self are the individuals each one of us while the connections are information and naimation is what brings the collective self to life a structre or system needs to have procedures and when you vote and when the president makes a speech that communication from him those words and those letters and those ideas expressed while it may contain very little information it causes quite a lot ot o say for example a declaration of war relate that sort of information back to entropy and how it rlates to thermal entropy and uantum entropy and theoretical shannon entropy.
  The self
  The self, like religion, currency, and borders, is a fiction. It is something that makes our lives easier, a tool out of which we construct meaning in our lives. Unlike religion, currency, and borders, the self is an individual fiction, something one cannot help but develop to make sense of, well, the senses arriving at our mind's door, barging in whether we want them to or not. The others are fictions at the scale of continents and civilizations. It seems we don't appear to have much of a choice as to whether we use these tools or not. You could choose not to recognize borders, religion, or currency--but depending on when and where you are, you probably won't last very long.  However, the self can be ignored with relatively little harm done to one's life. In fact entire religions seek the surrender of the self as the object of its practice. 
  heaven, hell
  Earth can be Heaven. Earth is Hell for many people, but it doesn't have to be. Human civilization can be seen as the millennia-long, ever continuing march towards a world where every human is without want nor need nor fear nor hate. Like Heaven, this state probably cannot exist.
  love, faith
  Faith is, like the unwavering belief that god exists, the knowledge that humanity will eventually unite. The trope that we will go back to the stone-age after global nuclear annihilation is very unlikely to play out. There will always be humans who exist, the knowledge of the Self (the knowledge of humans around the world) will most likely be preserved, and that social impetus to reunite will pull the survivors together, liberal humanism will ensure their survival, and it… unless people begin to be unable to have babies. Fuck. fuckkkk. Maybe it will just be mutations merging into the genetic pool. Something like us will survive. Not unreasonable to think this could happen. And maybe if we all behave as if it is true (by having faith) then it will be a self-fulfilling prophecy. And how is it that we behave to ensure this outcome? By loving one another. It has done great good in the past, and if everyone tries just a little bit harder to love one another--that is, to behave as though each individual (until unwarranted) is your family. She’s someone’s daughter, and she is loved, so why not join. He is someone’s brother, and he deserves to be loved, so why not love him like a brother?
  Love is the vehicle, faith shows us the way
  Reason
  big bang
  there was a bang, a firework, a bright flash of light. everything since then has been the embers cooling off in the sky. a speck of ash, floating near one of these embers, grows warm, allowing its constituent parts to begin molding and flowing and combining into different things. soon, on the surface of this oozing ash circling an ember floating in the night sky, there appears to be some sort of flowing taking on a life of its own.
  In the beginning there simply was, a presence, an energy above and beyond light and matter. A simple oneness, devoid of feature beyond its potential.
  “Times before before the end of inflation do not follow the same timeline”
  After the single presence there first came difference a something different from that, here to there, this and that, not simply one thing, but two things
  Symmetry breaking
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology_of_the_universe#Very_early_universe
  Gauge force
  The other, the something other than oneness became gravity soon after, came the strong--at this point the one is a felt force in space, a second feeling of pull or push, and a third: gravity, strong, ‘electroweak’
  Then electromagneticsm separates from weak, and there become the four fundamental fources of nature
  At this point, the universe began to be inflating to a much larger size, a number with 78 zeroes behind it. Or around 78 depending on your unit of length
  It’s not so much that space became bigger, but the speed of light (the speed of causality), the arrow of time, a degree of freedom released at each event spacetime point that is and ever will be
  And the velocity is what was expanded (or shrunk?) at one moment, each point in spacetime felt an incredible pressure, a repultion to everthing around it.
  After space had grown, the energy in it at every point becomes very thinly spread out, allowing another force to push out of the potenial an event with a vibration across all forces, but mostly in one like a spherical pluck of a string, sent off some direction. There were vibrations that matched (quark anti quark) in some property, and different in one, like looking in an upsidedown mirror, as well as gluons, which travel at the speed of light? While the quarks should have mass. Yes, but quarks at are at an energy level where mass is not able to yet grab glob onto it
  The universe is a fractal, where our forces branched off, extending like tendrils into what may as well be complex-valued real-valued dimensions beyond idea. Math has to come from somewhere.
  Scales
  Atom
  An orbiting electron, a captured electric field energy, has a charge when it is captured. The reason electrons can pair up down is because the second one cancels out the first, it interacts, rotating, orbiting, vibrating in the same way except to cancel, but I guess the mass creates the necessity of further orbital levels?
  Star
  More atoms
  Molecules/compounds
  Planets
  Life
  Replicators
  Genes
  Survival shells (bodies)
  (social) Conscousness




bioengineering/ai
Reason
Purpose of reason section is to build up justification for spirit section (mainly that spirit corresponds to other interconnections at lower scales
The patterns become more complicated (from simple symmetries to spacial (3d eg electron orbits) symmetries to further complex structures and further and further until you reach humans and then you add one more level which is interpersonal relationships
inevitability of global unification
“Our goal” is to create heaven on earth for all who are born, ideally all who are conceived, world peace
What is our current status on the path to our goal? Arguing over what constitutes a better basis for cooperation (capitalism, communism), bringing the entire world up to a tolerable base level basic level (eratication of disease, poverty, famine), and getting global organs to fully cooperate (globalization, war, developing countries)
^ our current status from the perspective of a single entity, humanity/universe
Knowledge (?)
A cavewoman transported to present-day Manhattan would not be able to comprehend what is around them, other than big, small, fast, complex objects, and other humans. When transported back, this may be all they would be able to describe. But if she and her prehistoric tribe had the language if she were able to somehow bring them with her, and if equiped with the necessary technologies of language and perhaps mathematics, they would be able to learn about everything as well as we can
Perhaps the tribe all decide they want to learn what a car is. They will, in effect be chizzelling away at an idea, in this case a prototype representation of a car in their heads. Words are created when they are needed, and eventually, after a sufficient amount of concepts have been chipped away, large form and small details, you are are left with an image of a car in your head that more or less represents what is really there, except in an abstract form stored in the individual and collective minds
The elegant universe
Eventually it will be humans and computers helping break down math problems, asking one another questions 316
M-theory allows up to 9-branes


oxygen molecule, two blobs of quarks with a certain number of electrons around each to allow them to stick to one another, build up new def for quarks earlier in book, exits julius cesear lungs and enters yours, find that, find better idea. talk about how an artery or vein is within x mm (find length of bateria or something) of tissue or whatever factoid. x number of cells! feeds each cell, each cell morphed from a single kind of cell, the instantiation of a human being, see certain section with regard to abortion, was going somewhere else as well... i forget. oh, we are fully replaced every 7 year, that factoid, see if exceptions like teeth or whatnot. just continuous waves of patterns, the faster and wavier the smaller you look. dancing tangles of energy building ever more complex braids. this will go after building up from cosmic egg, particles breaking apart, glow transition, use a bright light, farther away the less bright, then with fog at night or a heavy snowstorm with sun (sol, soul) overhead use Our Body once for earth then just use 'our body' our world is the planet, and the planet's world is the entire universe, or 'the world', so earth is 'our world', universe 'the world'
