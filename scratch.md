Reason
Purpose of reason section is to build up justification for spirit section (mainly that spirit corresponds to other interconnections at lower scales
The patterns become more complicated (from simple symmetries to spacial (3d eg electron orbits) symmetries to further complex structures and further and further until you reach humans and then you add one more level which is interpersonal relationships
inevitability of global unification
“Our goal” is to create heaven on earth for all who are born, ideally all who are conceived, world peace
What is our current status on the path to our goal? Arguing over what constitutes a better basis for cooperation (capitalism, communism), bringing the entire world up to a tolerable base level basic level (eratication of disease, poverty, famine), and getting global organs to fully cooperate (globalization, war, developing countries)
^ our current status from the perspective of a single entity, humanity/universe
Knowledge (?)
The elegant universe
Eventually it will be humans and computers helping break down math problems, asking one another questions 316
M-theory allows up to 9-branes


oxygen molecule, two blobs of quarks with a certain number of electrons around each to allow them to stick to one another, build up new def for quarks earlier in book, exits julius cesear lungs and enters yours, find that, find better idea. talk about how an artery or vein is within x mm (find length of bateria or something) of tissue or whatever factoid. x number of cells! feeds each cell, each cell morphed from a single kind of cell, the instantiation of a human being, see certain section with regard to abortion, was going somewhere else as well... i forget. oh, we are fully replaced every 7 year, that factoid, see if exceptions like teeth or whatnot. just continuous waves of patterns, the faster and wavier the smaller you look. dancing tangles of energy building ever more complex braids. this will go after building up from cosmic egg, particles breaking apart, glow transition, use a bright light, farther away the less bright, then with fog at night or a heavy snowstorm with sun (sol, soul) overhead use Our Body once for earth then just use 'our body' our world is the planet, and the planet's world is the entire universe, or 'the world', so earth is 'our world', universe 'the world'

if you were a [species] frog, you would be able to see or detect individual photons. a source of light from far away may dim to nothing for us, but the [species] frog would see a source of light flickering off and on very very quickly, mostly on, eventually just flashing a few seconds in-between
those few photons probably won't cause the frog to do much anything different, but it might
it may spot a cascading sensation of light from a coming fire-bearer, and jump away to safety
the same can be said for humans, but the light will simply be faint and grow brighter
that briefest of sensation could have wildly changed how you behaved
that light could be people coming to your rescue, or dreaded enemies on the prowl
this goes for the light from mars as well
if you have ever gazed up at that tiny red dot, it has had an effect on you
for most it may cause you to look up and nothing more
for some they gazed up right before kissing their partner for the first time
perhaps she got a tattoo of mars along with her partner, and it played as a beautiful motif for the rest of their lives
these small influences growing to huge changes are coming from everywhere, even as far away as mars
but mars is 100 million thousand meters away, 300,000,000 meters/s -> nearly an hour ago
even the sun is a few minutes in the past, were it to disappear we wouldn't immediately know
what we are, if we were to section off our body all we would be is a surface absorbing light and repelling electrons
our experience would simply be the fluctuations of energy or signals over this 2d boundary
instead, who and what we are extends out from your head, absorbing the past as it was 10 ms ago, then 1 second ago, then an hour ago, all the way out to the entire cosmos, as best as we can see it
we now know that who we are extends out until gravity was created because we experience the ripples of spacetime from objects like black holes from very far away, beyond where the light goes out
particles, little 0d points in space, are better described as one giant wave, spreading out as we move forward in time
we are learning that we are connected all together as one planet, one system, one galaxy, one universe
right now our capabilities are just barely reaching out beyond our planet
humans right now are committing perhaps the first global sin
we are not empowering those who understand the gravity of the situation
scores of beautiful species, expressions of god, will go extinct, and will only exist in recordings or fading memories
mass migration from places less habitable will grow in numbers
millions will be casualties
humanity will survive, we are a proud, hardy ape, but it will be shrouded in sadness

this is what we are, as best as we are able to tell
before the gravity of dust pulled itself together to form the earth, those specks of matter traveled from the inside of a star
maybe our dust ball comes from many different stars
before there were stars, there was a lot of hydrogen, which again pooled together into globs of matter, perpetually exploding from its immense energy
the hydrogen (and the rest of the gas atoms) was more energetic the farther you look back
eventually they are heated to the point where they fly apart, electrons bouncing against nucleons and light bouncing around both
suddenly there is bright orange light coming from every direction in space, as photons scatter about traveling millions of miles before entering your eye
you can see your hand, your body, and anything else around you, but distant objects fade into the blinding orange fog
as everything gets more crowded, bouncing against one another with ever-greater speed, the nucleons fly apart, releasing quarks and gluons to ricochet off electrons and photons
soon the light surrounding you grows dim, as all the photons grow to ever higher frequency
the world grows blue and then black as the light receeds from our color spectrum
forces begin merging together, combining particles together into things we have never witnessed
eventually you are left with simply one force, a smooth energy spread throughout an increasingly shrinking space
at some point time stops, and we are left with a single thing
moving forward in time tells about the same story
a simple pervasive energy split apart, into things that could then be put back together in interesting patterns
quarks begin sticking together, forming charges which interact with electrons
light appears, creeping from dark blue to white, which then fades to orange
as the quarks and electrons lost their energy, stable nucleon-electron waves began to form, spreading out into an expanding space
as locations became vacant of charge, being constrained to stable neutral regions separated by small distances of space, photons were able to travel among the atoms unimpeded, traveling billions of years until hitting your eye or another atom.
this moment of time, when light became unimpeded can be seen when plotting the cosmic microwave background
a photon was allowed to travel in a straight line, losing energy as it is stretched through space, then hit the lens of a satellite
the atoms formed stars, and those stars formed bigger atoms, and those bigger atoms form you
first they group into simple patterns, different configurations of atoms stuck together from their electrons
these tiny groups grow into more complex patterns, large spacial configurations of dozens of different atoms
the bigger pieces begin to clump together
those bigger pieces grow into a living organism, with a variety of complex systems maintaining a process inside a tiny bag of water
those tiny bags clump together, creating more clumps similar to it, and given enough time these clumps will turn into a human

just look at the other, what you want, and aim towards that, perf and all

- Stars are not how far away but rather how long ago
- The longer I go the less it affects you or rather a sphere around you a star it's light it's gravity it's affect on me could be described not could can be described with very little information very little very high entropy
- The information the entry crosses the spherical boundary this circle boundary the entropy crosses
- connect back to Mars and the proposal
- consider Vega for most people they will never know what Vega is and that's okay most people will gaze up not knowing what they're looking at but noticing the brightness of one particular one particular star this will affect some subset of the human population or rather all living things like the Earth itself the Earth is one living thing the moon the moon has tons of entropy it affects everyone vega may not affect someone who doesn't know what they're looking at but it plays a small small part in their lives an astronomer dedicates their life to stars like viga and this greatly influences their life The information stored in the brain encoded in the electrochemical loops Is highly entangled with all of us but more so with the astronomer because there is more information being held inside your sphere The information crossing your sphere The Earth is one living thing and that is what makes it so precious that is the blue marble
- the moon influences as greatly but it is not a living thing The sun gives us life but it is not life itself itself is not living it itself is not living
- that is what makes us special that is what makes us one thing
- The center of the Earth is not living we are simply a moss grown around a massive clump of dirt but the dirt also gives us energy the dirt and the sun are stores of energy that give birth the father is the son the Earth is the mother and we are the moss that has grown around it
- we are highly intangled with the other side of the Earth both with scar with regards to space time as well as the information as it travels from one sphere when subset of the big sphere this big information sphere that is the Earth what the crosses from one subset of the Earth IE a liter of a deleter Japan the liter of Japan deleter of Japan wow extra information such as what new policy is inacted and how it affects your site of the Earth that is extra information on top of the physical information which makes up the physical emperor there's information and tangled in his brain most of it unless he dies or something else happens to his whole body mind is subset of body or maybe solid subset of mind because that is the glue it's social like a pack of dogs um yes so the necessary ingredient for the connection between humans it a substance of the mind or maybe more fundamental of and the mind is a subset of the body so maybe the mind is more fundamental than the body that does make sense oh no um mine does built up from the body The body has built up from the earth the soul is built up from the mind it is a pinnacle it is perhaps more beautiful
- what we are like is a video game we have a state a position on the map a certain number of health points and so on we also have rules by which the state changes in time for an AI enemy there are rules steps discreet steps by which it changes with time such as approaching or firing at you there are exact rules Andy you follow these rules yourself but that let's not think about that right now likewise we have a state a position for instance where you are or where every particle in your body is the fuzzing the fuzzing between the particles as information travels from point to point there's a constant jiggling because things are constantly moving because they don't have an entirely definite position look into that this fuzzing is what allows you to travel through the world's or navigate your branch in your brain your space time braid
- elaborate on this braid it is a braid because unlike the game which ticks in very tiny discreet steps our time is continuous space time is continuous and because we are fortunational beans not three dimensional plus time we are four dimensional what seems like a point is actually traced a line of energy through a braid these different braids as they constantly split apart Is that entropy when there's more splitting apart the more you have to know how things change as they ever they branch out they they constantly bloom out a perpetually blooming flower with ever more petals behind the last the next
- this braid the more complex the braid the more entropy the more information it requires and that is why a random star in the sky does not add as much information because it's only sending a fuzzy wave of electrons
- and then go into how we discovered that the rule the rules by which our game state changes describes a wave a particle is a ripple we are just one point along this ripple but like a drop of water like a drop of water hitting a pond spreads out in all directions this spreading is the infinite regress of petals

like any model every word in this text is false, but it might be useful

when time first began there was only energy. no particular time pure in its form. there was also bass space, rapidly inflating outwards due to this presence of energy. it all pushed away from itself

at some point, the singular energy split apart into two different kinds, one which pushes and pulls, and one that only pulls[1.1

knowing a position between the moon and the earth to within the breadth of a human hair (12 decimal points)

a particle is the cross-section of a braid an energy braid a braid of energy
wheeler back and forth strand of electron (electron strand) looks, in slices, like many electron particles

anything can happen as long as it happens fast enough to detect dedt > h
field sits at zero, but if you look, its fluctuating around zero. look closer, bigger flucs, more energetic particles? 
knot is quarks, gluons jump gap

it is only on rare occasions that you do not feel the ground beneath your feet it is not that we are simply tethered to the Earth we are extensions of it

The branching that Sean Carroll talks about the gradually getting thinner of a particular world can be thought of as a hardening. when we think of ourselves as spreading out Is not just us that spreads out it is the whole earth it is every object in the universe every interaction the reason that solid objects do not behave quantum mechanically Is this hardening this crystallization of interactions a single particle two single particles pretty out somewhere in the wave function of the universe this spherical body of water with different kinds of waves overlapping one another locations particular spots where two waves meet have a tendency or can stick together like protons and neutrons nucleons and electrons a nucleon is not little ball stuck together it is one big sphere that spreads out that has an extent in space due to the uncertainty principle the same reason that degenerate matter is I guess so hot um so I am branching out I'm spreading out I'm walking around in different patterns in different worlds oh but as the special extensives begin gluing together over larger distances it's not able to spread out as much because information has to travel between those distances this is also where MC squared comes into play the c squared it is I guess how much to say photos able to spread out over a period of time which is some sort of area some sort of velocity squared area

film soundtrack that is composed only of heartbeat rhythms where the number of rhythms allowed is equal to the number of characters being portrayed on screen


picture 2 points on our circle pond spherical hollow shell pond with different kinds of waves Ripley together and two particles of two different fields meet this moment of the two particles meeting two dots being carried out from two spherical wave fronts they meet and that meeting point itself begins to spread out and say a spherical wavefront or perhaps directed but because these two particles might stick together and because momentum must be conserved these two faster particles maze slow down and therefore not able to spread out as much spread out at the circular cross sections of the light cone I guess so maybe the stitching together of space time are these little areas spreading out spreading out of possibility proportional to the area of c squared

picture yourself driving in your car with a falcon with a bird watching over head or better yet a time lapse from a spy satellite you will appear to circle around or hover around particular spots maybe there are different spots within a larger spot with sudden jumps to another spot corresponding to wind you were driving your car from spot-to-spot these themselves will form loops larger connections most people make the same commute every day following the same loop but they also go other places perhaps less frequently and perhaps they travel far very rarely looked at fast enough you will look like a particle moving around in a larger emergent pattern these patterns spread out along with the entire Earth and every particle in the universe the observable universe but much more slowly than a particle or an atom or a molecule
