- what we are
  - timeline
    - bb to flash
      - in the beginning there was energy. at least near the beginning. we know there was energy a few seconds after the beginning, solely existing as a thick soup of isolated points of potential separated by brief gaps filled with the ripples of their wake. we know there was energy a blink after the beginning, and are pretty sure of what that looked like as well. but the beginning itself we simply cannot say what was there. but most likely, it was energy.
    - flash to now
      - right now there is energy as well. everything we see and feel is energy. but it looks like many different things.
      - the only way we know what happened before we existed, is because we know what is happening now, and are able to compare that to what is happening now, i.e. a short time after. we can say that before earth existed, everything was closer together. a time traveling astronaut would see all the stars and galaxies we see today, but they'd be closer. and as a consequence, things would be brighter and hotter. it was also a lot dustier. and billions of years before that
      - particles -> atoms -> compounds -> amino acids -> proteins -> structures (viruses, single celled organisms talk about the green orb!?) -> cells (tiny blob with organs, don't use the name cell, use the water blob analogy, dedicated funtional parts (organelles), stem cells for all creatures? moss? cells morphing into different shapes to serve different functions? -> fish (short sight, maybe talk about eyes?) -> lizard (land motors?) -> mammals (lenghtening of time to think, putting evolutionary pressure on accumulating thoughts that can lengthen survival rate) -> humans (start reading selfish gene)
  - now back to bb
  - meet in middle?
  - common patterns of relative position, increasing time+complexity, building blocks of structures built at ever greater scales
    - the more space you have for a system be a molecule or a cell or plants around a sun it takes more time for the elements of that system to change so atomic reaction takes very little time to change because of very low space and so it takes very low time for information to travel whereas ATP in a cell has powder to go and it's possibly bumping into things and so the interaction between the organelles takes longer to happen also because there's more space look into the wavelength of a chair for a cow and figure out what mass it passes the plunk length The time it takes for a social system takes longer both because it takes place over a longer period of space time or I guess FaceTime proper time is always the same but I don't know I guess I'll collective shared time data day life really only usually matters from milliseconds to seconds but all these shapes are more or less arbitrary but happened to work together different molecules combined to make new molecules but they fit together in certain orientations and making different shapes these patterns grow the shapes and objects involve more complicated but the shapes are still more or less arbitrary we give them names like organelles or humans but the shape is just a shape that works and the farther down you look the fewer and fewer shapes you find or simpler shapes if the shapes get simpler because space is much smaller and so the ways they fit together the number of ways becomes smaller like the limitations of the atoms where the shape is very restricted to particle interactions which are moralist just well I guess couplings between different energy fields different ways that energy can be shaped into
    - each of these building blocks combines with others to create ever more complex structures, which, because by definition are larger, and it takes longer for lower blocks to navigate or interact with one another (check this idea) the strucures get more complicated, but the rate at which things happen (mixing chemicals -> separating dna -> making a baby or doing the dishes) takes longer and longer
  - physics
    - there is a long pattern in science, of finding out there is a lot more stuff than we thought. land then planets then stars, one galaxy, many galaxies. go into the cosmic landscape. now go meditate.
    - is it accurate to say instead of many worlds, it's just one world (1, 100%) and we spread out in different ways
    - the math ends up correct. this is survival bias, it is incorrect much more, but when it's correct it describes the world in ways that are initially strange, and then end up being correct. the equation describing how an electron behaves when it is alone (and not rippling around a nucleus) called the dirac equation, had two solutions, one for particles with -1 charge, and others for +1 charge--they were both solutions to the equation, numbers that fit the pattern, but we had only ever seen electrons, not positively charged "positrons". now we use positrons in PET scan machines. it predicted anti-matter and then we found it. the same story goes for black holes. the speed of light. spacetime. there is a conjecture in modern physics called ER = EPR, meaning these two papers about qm and gravity are deeply related. basically that spacetime is stiched together via microscopic wormholes. right now we know that we are a wave, describe classical state vs like drops of rain on the surface of a pond ripples and waves on something. not the water, the height of a wave is the field.
    - there is one event in the wave in which I am typing a bit more slowly, or make a typo. there are events where i am getting up, or looking at my phone. if you superimpose all these actions onto one another, and all the wide variations you can literally think of, will be placed on top of one another, myself occupying a single entity, and yet trillions of versions of me, it will look like i am spreading out, almost like a drop of water spreading out after hitting the surface of water. but it's not just you spreading out, it's everyone else, the planet and the stars, all the way back to the ends of the universe, where those located events are from a long time ago. we can say this confidently, because we have discovered quantum mechanics. what is so amazing about physics, is that things that happen in our world, the reality we experience (or rather the shared experience we all agree upon) have relatively simple math equations to explain them, and over and over again, equations are found that can be transformed into two other equations, combining phenomena, things that happen, events, and remain a relatively simple equation! what isaac newton is big because he unified the equations of our world, and the whole world, the moon, planets and stars, he united us with what is huge. quantum mechanics, the work of many physicist, has united us with what is fundamental--the smallest, simplest building blocks that make up the entire world. most of classical mechanics (excluding general relativity) can be derived from equations of quantum mechanics. and quantum mechanics tells us that, while what we see are itty bitty specs/particles, what there really is, is a wave, where we are at a particular spot on that wave. we can know things about this wave, but we are limited in our knowledge. we can know how fast the wave if moving, rippling outwards, but not where we are on that wave. we can know how much energy this wave is carrying (drip or tsunami?), or we can know when exactly something happens, but not both. (check this). what we see is where we are in the wave, but what we see is not all that is there. what is there is a wave. talk about how replacing particles themselves with waves unites even more phenomena, separately having their own equations. then how gr doesn't fit in because, while quantum fields take place on the backdrop of relative spacetime, where everything is nice and straight, gr tells us that spacetime bends, stretches, smooshes, and this is currently where We are searching for an equation that can be turned into both those of qft and gr.
    - we haven't seen the graviton because it might just be too heavy. heavy meaning the amount of "stuff" it has, not its density or gravitational force, though the graviton does feel a force to other 'massive' (mass-having) objects, like planets or particles or people, and the graviton does have a density. an electron has an amount of mass, and so does a graviton. but the graviton weighs much than the electron, and, because we have discovered that energy in its most general sense, and mass or "stuff" are the same thing. so to make a graviton, we have to put in a lot of energy. so we take a large amount of other massive particles, and throw them together as fast as we can. scratch graviton, start with massive particle, then use e=mcc to e/cc=m to explain photon and graviton (energy not mass?) check all this.
    - it's all just a projection. what you are experiencing right now is the synthesis of two projections of light, hitting the 2d surface of the lens of your eye, focused onto a 2d array of photosensors. light blippers. blinking little eyes only seeing a certain wavelength or intensity. always a projection. we can only look at things in a smaller and smaller spherical shell surrounding a volume. the smaller you look, the less particles you look at, until eventually seeing only a few blips of energy enter or exit the sphere. we don't know what happens inside the sphere on which the blips were detected. (physicists pretend that everything happens and choose the most probable one) push enough particles into a space, and sometimes you can get one big heavy one out. the more we push in, the more particles we find. instead of particles on the surface of a sphere, they are ripples of energy, and our world can see where we are in the ripple, and it will look like a point. we are 4d beings. the flow of reality and where we are in it are different for you and me, but our spacetime is the same, everywhere. spacetime, ourself, itself is stretched by mass like stars and planets and you and me and a grain of sand and dust. like heavy balls on a rubber sheet, when close enough rolling into one another, or more likely, rolling around it in one big loop. we are twirling around the sun. but the sun is twirling around our galaxy. which itself is being whisked about by ever greater twirls! eventually, if you look far back enough to when we were but just an endless sea of itty bitty specks, forged in the fires of the beginning. their position, while random, begins to pull the closer specks to one another, and farther specks less so. these condensing pools, exactly because it's usually a loop rather than a collision, these condensing pools of bits begin to twirl. at some point, there began a twirl. zoom all the way back in to where you are sitting now, and it seems like a dizzying sequence of spinning into oblivion. go into the full sequence of spinnings, stars into clusters into galaxies into clusters etc.
  - the human experience
    - it looks like the stuff of you and i, and the colors emerging from a prism. it feels like the soft fur of an animal or the unique sensation of a cold breeze intermingling with the sharp warmth of the sun. taste touch sight sound and feeling. all of this is energy, and we know these different kinds of energy are the same.
    - what you experience as "real" is always 10-100 ms in the past, depending on the senses used to build that experience. a video playing at 100 fps would flash one time over the duration of 10 ms, and flash 10 times over 100 ms. a 28 fps film would flash less than 3 times over 100 ms. so if you were bitten by a mosquito, or absorbing photons from mars, it will be a bit before you noticed.
    - soundwaves are just billiard balls quiet noises are vibrations loud noises are billiard balls constantly hitting your eardrum pressing it in loud enough and given periods of time instances of time where there is a wavefront of particles away front of kinetic energy than your eardrum could be damaged use that as an example of one of the census or explain all the senses where seeing is the only one that uses electromagnetic magnetic radiation as far as I know taste and smell are little itty bitty molecules touch of touches electric energy and electric field site electromagnetic field ripples electromagnetic ripples and the rest are complex interactions of molecules or simple st taste smell and hearing
    - A cavewoman transported to present-day Manhattan would not be able to comprehend what is around them, other than big, small, fast, complex objects, and other humans. When transported back, this may be all they would be able to describe. But if she and her prehistoric tribe had the language if she were able to somehow bring them with her, and if equiped with the necessary technologies of language and perhaps mathematics, they would be able to learn about everything as well as we can
    - Perhaps the tribe all decide they want to learn what a car is. They will, in effect be chizzelling away at an idea, in this case a prototype representation of a car in their heads. Words are created when they are needed, and eventually, after a sufficient amount of concepts have been chipped away, large form and small details, you are are left with an image of a car in your head that more or less represents what is really there, except in an abstract form stored in the individual and collective minds
- what We are
  - human to humanity
    - objects and signals
      - vocal sounds to meaning
      - analigy to fermions+bosons, organelles to proteins, etc.
      - one of these patterns is particularly important to humans, and we call that pattern ‘love’. it’s a messy pattern, for sure. the pattern of love is an intricate dance between billions of objects taking place over millions of years. These objects, projecting and bouncing off of one another in a myriad of brief intricate interactions, are only present again in a short moment in time, emerging from nothing and eventually disappearing again, spreading out among the others until all these things scattering about all look like just one big messy ball of frothing matter moving through spacetime, each instance an intricate braid of that one energy, god rippling about, forming ever smaller dances among itself. We are the objects, the one mass is earth, and the brief interactions, fancy vibrations bouncing against one another, is love. One of the patterns seen among all of these sacks of dirty water is holding hands. It is an expression of love among one or more people, and everyone does it because it is (more or less) universally agreed upon that it “feels good”. There are a lot, not nearly as many, but a lot of people who do not think holding hands feels good, and indeed there are much more between the two, if you look close enough an entire spectrum of people who would say that they believe holding hands with someone you want to hold hands with, and who also wants to hold hands with you, feels good. Spanning from the first to the last person, the just born, who while are not yet able to articulate it, clearly show content being held in their mother’s arms, to the hundred or so people who are dying this very minute, either holding the hand of loved ones, or wishes they were doing so.
  - humanity to planet
  - planet to universe
    - argue the case that there is only one thing and that thing is you and me and the animals and the earth and the sun and the moon and all the stars and indeed everything there is in the universe and we can call that one thing god. then, we can use this knowledge to figure out what to do. how to behave. what's the goal. one such goal is the possibility of forward time travel, and when we get our shit together then we'll join a larger timeline. causal timeline. but also if you and me and the trees and the ocean are expressions of god, then we will want to treat ourselves as well as we can. a myriad of reasons.
    - insert talk about extending to the sun, moon, system, galaxy, and ultimately the whole universe, mostly the cosmic microwave background, but a little bit before that as well, back when perhaps there were only a trillion things, or a billion, maybe even just a few. That far distant galaxy is not a part of you, but the photons and gravity being emitted from them are hitting us this very moment. It is both far away and a long time ago, but it is fully a part of your experience, whether you are looking through a telescope or not. You personally may not be effected that very moment, the galaxy may not even be facing you, visible in the sky. Maybe at the other end of the earth, but it does hit the earth, and on a long enough timescale, you and me and we and the earth are all the same thing.
  - trinities
    - mind-body-soul
    - per-phy-con
      - explore the idea of the three kinds of realities individual reality consensus reality and actual reality objective reality and if it can be seen that they are all the same thing where the individual is just a loop of input and output put the output mean the cross thought the experiences real it's a part of ejector reality consensus more or less and then consensus is just hey explore that and then right now there is not a consensus reality
    - their duality?
      - mind is the reality one personally experiences, the blinds through which existence is experienced. i think therefore i am, which means roughly in order to question the existence of myself, there must be something to do the questioning. your body, including your brain and the electrical signals therein, are physical reality, the building blocks that are there regardless of whether an i is around to experience it. the personal emerges from the physical, and the physical is known from sentient concousness. the soul is that which spreads out among humans, permiating through our social networks and communities and eventually the whole world. this is why the sky is blue, because we have a broad consensus that the sound/word 'sky' is *that*, and the color of that is a 'shade of blue'. the closer we come to a single consensus reality, the closer we will be to who We truly are.
      - mind-body: that point where the electro-chemical sensory inputs are transformed into a coherent whole, i.e. your conscious experience. delay of 10-100ms
      - mind-soul: mirror neurons, your thoughts, memories, and feelings about other living beings, or Our world as a whole, and the tmf of you within the brains and minds of others
      - body-soul: a rock does not have a soul, because no reciprical connection? explore idea. the body is the means by which the soul flows, grows, and explores. fermions and bosons. just mind-body but where the body is the earth, system, universe
      - per-phy: personal emerges from physical patterns. spacetime braids, but replace with waves and call it spacetime blooms, a perpectual unfolding of what mostly is, as well as what could have been.
      - per-con: the necessary ingredient for a consensus to form. when a soul emerges. two people needed to form a consensus, strongest when the consensus is mutual love for each person.
      - phy-con: to varying degrees within the body politic, the ingredients of the consensus, Us, we will under stand better and better what the physical is. that is, what We are. physics as the study of god. per-phy may have beliefs of what We are, but there are much better reasons to believe the consensus of the physical community, because it is much closer to the truth. god.
- implications/how to live
  - make a sermon. make the wave the church. teach multicultural loving-kindness to adults, teach kids about the wave. there is a lot of me sitting here typing, there's also a good amount of me getting up and petting my cat. there's not a lot of me running down the street and screaming like a maniac at this moment, but there's some. there's a little bit of me exploding, but my smoldering remains are impossibly small to see compared to the rest. and it just so happens that it is quite convenient in math to call it "one" teach one, then halves, and so on, and that the better you are to one another, there is a *ton* more good version of you.

write. for however long. no matter what. just write. and then edit! edit some other time. you can extract out good chunks, or organize them! tag them by subject or what have you.

thought occurs that i'm going slowly, or that I'm wasting my time.

why i will never eat meat again

as we learn more and more, ad 
i want my book to have a form, a narrative, a story to tell. i can do this by first describing what it is i want to write, and then filling that out to write it. then edit. so what is my goal. see beyond yourself. so, three sections right? 1. what we are: start from the beginning and a single particle. grow from there. sprinkle in some space and time. end at self-aware complex life, still described only in the abstract, with perhaps a concrete example here or there. use this as a base for the argument made in 2. you and i are one in the same, then all of the earth, then the whole universe. name this thing god, and schrodiger said god ripples. back this up with science. 3. is implications. go read a book about hume. What does this say about religion? 

In the beginning there was energy. Before there were many things, there was just one thing. physicists call this one thing energy, and theologians call it god. this one thing became two, then many, then billions, then googols, then uncountably more, possibly even an infinite number. these different things, just about everything, form patterns, there are small patterns, big ones, beautiful patterns and terrible ones. but each is incredible in its own way.  Ultimately, if you look close enough, each of us, these messy blobs emerging from the earth, dancing among themselves then spreading again out among everything else, are location-specific waves “wavelets” following relatively simple patterns, simple enough to put into short-ish math equations. Ultimately, you me, us, the earth, is made out of the whole thing.

Spirit
* mind, body, soul
  The triad
  The mind is not one mind, thank god, because diversity of thought is our greatest strength. We are not one body, thank god, because redundancy greatly benefits our physical surivival, and we are not one soul, because I’m likely to not have any social interaction with someone on the other side of the planet. But we’re not exactly different souls, I don’t think. Because the tendrils of causality expanding out of me, or the atoms that represent me at this event, may very well effect someone on the other side of the planet. I could join a growing company that eventually impoverishes a village. Compounding social interaction, even miniscule or minor, can ripple through the connections we all have to one another.
  Maybe thinking of one mind is just as extreme as thinking of many individual minds, because we are not individual minds, we become entangled as we braid ourselves through the universe together. It just looks very individualistic from our vantage points, and such is our soul, through those tiny tendrils we each thrust into the future.
  The atoms of our collective Self are the individuals each one of us while the connections are information and naimation is what brings the collective self to life a structre or system needs to have procedures and when you vote and when the president makes a speech that communication from him those words and those letters and those ideas expressed while it may contain very little information it causes quite a lot ot o say for example a declaration of war relate that sort of information back to entropy and how it rlates to thermal entropy and uantum entropy and theoretical shannon entropy.
  The self
  The self, like religion, currency, and borders, is a fiction. It is something that makes our lives easier, a tool out of which we construct meaning in our lives. Unlike religion, currency, and borders, the self is an individual fiction, something one cannot help but develop to make sense of, well, the senses arriving at our mind's door, barging in whether we want them to or not. The others are fictions at the scale of continents and civilizations. It seems we don't appear to have much of a choice as to whether we use these tools or not. You could choose not to recognize borders, religion, or currency--but depending on when and where you are, you probably won't last very long.  However, the self can be ignored with relatively little harm done to one's life. In fact entire religions seek the surrender of the self as the object of its practice. 
  heaven, hell
  Earth can be Heaven. Earth is Hell for many people, but it doesn't have to be. Human civilization can be seen as the millennia-long, ever continuing march towards a world where every human is without want nor need nor fear nor hate. Like Heaven, this state probably cannot exist.
  love, faith
  Love is the vehicle, faith shows us the way
  Reason
  big bang
  there was a bang, a firework, a bright flash of light. everything since then has been the embers cooling off in the sky. a speck of ash, floating near one of these embers, grows warm, allowing its constituent parts to begin molding and flowing and combining into different things. soon, on the surface of this oozing ash circling an ember floating in the night sky, there appears to be some sort of flowing taking on a life of its own.
  In the beginning there simply was, a presence, an energy above and beyond light and matter. A simple oneness, devoid of feature beyond its potential.
  “Times before before the end of inflation do not follow the same timeline”
  After the single presence there first came difference a something different from that, here to there, this and that, not simply one thing, but two things
  Symmetry breaking
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology_of_the_universe#Very_early_universe
  Gauge force
  The other, the something other than oneness became gravity soon after, came the strong--at this point the one is a felt force in space, a second feeling of pull or push, and a third: gravity, strong, ‘electroweak’
  Then electromagneticsm separates from weak, and there become the four fundamental fources of nature
  At this point, the universe began to be inflating to a much larger size, a number with 78 zeroes behind it. Or around 78 depending on your unit of length
  It’s not so much that space became bigger, but the speed of light (the speed of causality), the arrow of time, a degree of freedom released at each event spacetime point that is and ever will be
  And the velocity is what was expanded (or shrunk?) at one moment, each point in spacetime felt an incredible pressure, a repultion to everthing around it.
  After space had grown, the energy in it at every point becomes very thinly spread out, allowing another force to push out of the potenial an event with a vibration across all forces, but mostly in one like a spherical pluck of a string, sent off some direction. There were vibrations that matched (quark anti quark) in some property, and different in one, like looking in an upsidedown mirror, as well as gluons, which travel at the speed of light? While the quarks should have mass. Yes, but quarks at are at an energy level where mass is not able to yet grab glob onto it
  The universe is a fractal, where our forces branched off, extending like tendrils into what may as well be complex-valued real-valued dimensions beyond idea. Math has to come from somewhere.
  Scales
  Atom
  An orbiting electron, a captured electric field energy, has a charge when it is captured. The reason electrons can pair up down is because the second one cancels out the first, it interacts, rotating, orbiting, vibrating in the same way except to cancel, but I guess the mass creates the necessity of further orbital levels?
  Star
  More atoms
  Molecules/compounds
  Planets
  Life
  Replicators
  Genes
  Survival shells (bodies)
  (social) Conscousness




bioengineering/ai
Reason
Purpose of reason section is to build up justification for spirit section (mainly that spirit corresponds to other interconnections at lower scales
The patterns become more complicated (from simple symmetries to spacial (3d eg electron orbits) symmetries to further complex structures and further and further until you reach humans and then you add one more level which is interpersonal relationships
inevitability of global unification
“Our goal” is to create heaven on earth for all who are born, ideally all who are conceived, world peace
What is our current status on the path to our goal? Arguing over what constitutes a better basis for cooperation (capitalism, communism), bringing the entire world up to a tolerable base level basic level (eratication of disease, poverty, famine), and getting global organs to fully cooperate (globalization, war, developing countries)
^ our current status from the perspective of a single entity, humanity/universe
Knowledge (?)
The elegant universe
Eventually it will be humans and computers helping break down math problems, asking one another questions 316
M-theory allows up to 9-branes


oxygen molecule, two blobs of quarks with a certain number of electrons around each to allow them to stick to one another, build up new def for quarks earlier in book, exits julius cesear lungs and enters yours, find that, find better idea. talk about how an artery or vein is within x mm (find length of bateria or something) of tissue or whatever factoid. x number of cells! feeds each cell, each cell morphed from a single kind of cell, the instantiation of a human being, see certain section with regard to abortion, was going somewhere else as well... i forget. oh, we are fully replaced every 7 year, that factoid, see if exceptions like teeth or whatnot. just continuous waves of patterns, the faster and wavier the smaller you look. dancing tangles of energy building ever more complex braids. this will go after building up from cosmic egg, particles breaking apart, glow transition, use a bright light, farther away the less bright, then with fog at night or a heavy snowstorm with sun (sol, soul) overhead use Our Body once for earth then just use 'our body' our world is the planet, and the planet's world is the entire universe, or 'the world', so earth is 'our world', universe 'the world'

if you were a [species] frog, you would be able to see or detect individual photons. a source of light from far away may dim to nothing for us, but the [species] frog would see a source of light flickering off and on very very quickly, mostly on, eventually just flashing a few seconds in-between
those few photons probably won't cause the frog to do much anything different, but it might
it may spot a cascading sensation of light from a coming fire-bearer, and jump away to safety
the same can be said for humans, but the light will simply be faint and grow brighter
that briefest of sensation could have wildly changed how you behaved
that light could be people coming to your rescue, or dreaded enemies on the prowl
this goes for the light from mars as well
if you have ever gazed up at that tiny red dot, it has had an effect on you
for most it may cause you to look up and nothing more
for some they gazed up right before kissing their partner for the first time
perhaps she got a tattoo of mars along with her partner, and it played as a beautiful motif for the rest of their lives
these small influences growing to huge changes are coming from everywhere, even as far away as mars
but mars is 100 million thousand meters away, 300,000,000 meters/s -> nearly an hour ago
even the sun is a few minutes in the past, were it to disappear we wouldn't immediately know
what we are, if we were to section off our body all we would be is a surface absorbing light and repelling electrons
our experience would simply be the fluctuations of energy or signals over this 2d boundary
instead, who and what we are extends out from your head, absorbing the past as it was 10 ms ago, then 1 second ago, then an hour ago, all the way out to the entire cosmos, as best as we can see it
we now know that who we are extends out until gravity was created because we experience the ripples of spacetime from objects like black holes from very far away, beyond where the light goes out
particles, little 0d points in space, are better described as one giant wave, spreading out as we move forward in time
we are learning that we are connected all together as one planet, one system, one galaxy, one universe
right now our capabilities are just barely reaching out beyond our planet
humans right now are committing perhaps the first global sin
we are not empowering those who understand the gravity of the situation
scores of beautiful species, expressions of god, will go extinct, and will only exist in recordings or fading memories
mass migration from places less habitable will grow in numbers
millions will be casualties
humanity will survive, we are a proud, hardy ape, but it will be shrouded in sadness

this is what we are, as best as we are able to tell
before the gravity of dust pulled itself together to form the earth, those specks of matter traveled from the inside of a star
maybe our dust ball comes from many different stars
before there were stars, there was a lot of hydrogen, which again pooled together into globs of matter, perpetually exploding from its immense energy
the hydrogen (and the rest of the gas atoms) was more energetic the farther you look back
eventually they are heated to the point where they fly apart, electrons bouncing against nucleons and light bouncing around both
suddenly there is bright orange light coming from every direction in space, as photons scatter about traveling millions of miles before entering your eye
you can see your hand, your body, and anything else around you, but distant objects fade into the blinding orange fog
as everything gets more crowded, bouncing against one another with ever-greater speed, the nucleons fly apart, releasing quarks and gluons to ricochet off electrons and photons
soon the light surrounding you grows dim, as all the photons grow to ever higher frequency
the world grows blue and then black as the light receeds from our color spectrum
forces begin merging together, combining particles together into things we have never witnessed
eventually you are left with simply one force, a smooth energy spread throughout an increasingly shrinking space
at some point time stops, and we are left with a single thing
moving forward in time tells about the same story
a simple pervasive energy split apart, into things that could then be put back together in interesting patterns
quarks begin sticking together, forming charges which interact with electrons
light appears, creeping from dark blue to white, which then fades to orange
as the quarks and electrons lost their energy, stable nucleon-electron waves began to form, spreading out into an expanding space
as locations became vacant of charge, being constrained to stable neutral regions separated by small distances of space, photons were able to travel among the atoms unimpeded, traveling billions of years until hitting your eye or another atom.
this moment of time, when light became unimpeded can be seen when plotting the cosmic microwave background
a photon was allowed to travel in a straight line, losing energy as it is stretched through space, then hit the lens of a satellite
the atoms formed stars, and those stars formed bigger atoms, and those bigger atoms form you
first they group into simple patterns, different configurations of atoms stuck together from their electrons
these tiny groups grow into more complex patterns, large spacial configurations of dozens of different atoms
the bigger pieces begin to clump together
those bigger pieces grow into a living organism, with a variety of complex systems maintaining a process inside a tiny bag of water
those tiny bags clump together, creating more clumps similar to it, and given enough time these clumps will turn into a human
very very early on, reality split into different forms of energy, and everything after has been the result of those energies forming spacial configurations of increasing size and complexity, taking longer for more complex patterns to play out

one may think that qm, gr, none of this affects me, but they do! you are likely reading this on a giant array of very tiny spotlights, each showing different colors to assemble the words that you see. gps, unaccounting gr, would grow inaccurate at a rate of X meters/hr/min. these are newer technologies, but the same could be said of future tech. cern second order effects, besides finding the higgs. all the other discoveries and cutting edge tech left in its wake. webb tele!

just look at the other, what you want, and aim towards that, perf and all

isomorphism of mind-body-soul and personal-physical-consensus realities

###### google notes
- 
- the pattern of rhodes with different turns and branches and lights and traffic flows are repeated patterns and those patterns might not be exact they might be statistical patterns in nature but lots of patterns are statistical for incense in a cell the different proteins giggling around in water are much like a snow globe being shaken filled with a wide variety of proteins and other molecules and the system operates probabilistically or statistically in how not in how 1 ATP molecule loaded spring it's not about that HP molecule tripper scene from one organelle to another but rather getting enough of those molecules from one organelle to another just like the flow of cars on roads stretching and creeping and growing at a fractal pattern
- put a disclaimer saying that you as far as you are concerned that everything that you have written here is not true until agreed upon by a rough majority of our collective consensus reality or at least among the relevant communities and then accept get her issues and pull requests for scientific or other errors
- try and make it so the main text only uses the simplified winky words
- Make the secular spirit website look exactly like a book pretty sure I've had this idea before
- Russian doll patterns
- classical vs quantum. the moon has entered our lives, we went there as human. soon mars will enter our world in a much more meaningful way, and that's a long ways away. and there's the mother sun, the source which lets us keep going for as long as we need it. but the earth is us. we have decohered as more or less this big ol' ship called planet earth. i spread, but it is always with you as well.

i perform civil-social maintenance
- as Sean Carroll says it we are not so much splitting or our universe our experience is just getting thinner the whole universe but your branch is getting thinner this thinning branch is the braid through space time would virtual particles then possibly be real particles in other branches of the universe
- according to general relativity in the frame of reference foreign object makes most sense to be that of the object of cell of that itself for example and apple traveling in a parabola through the air because we choose to Define our frame of reference the ground below us we can use that as some sort of metaphor for all being a part of one Earth and that's what we actually are I'm not sure and see if you are that end somewhere
- forms of beauty only a cat can see
they don't have poetry
but their feelings are just as deep
- Dolphins as a species have greater Souls than those of humans
- in the book describe not just humans but other animals animals like dolphins that are highly evolved and display soul in the abstract terms that are developed
- we emphasize to yourself that you're splitting through space-time as the little tiny molecules in your brain create different paths or different worlds that is a as far as we can tell a literal real thing and me and besides that to yourself
use that as a motivation to control that path
